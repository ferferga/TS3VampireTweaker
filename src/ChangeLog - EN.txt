After executing this command, a window (in English) appear saying being cleaned to all sims. Click the tick. About
seconds later
another window will appear (in case you have to clean sims) with the following message:

"Cleaning (sim name)"

And press the tick. We hope and we must leave the window below to find out is complete uninstallation correctly

"Cleaned (sim name)"

In case there are any errors, the mod will inform you with an error message. However, this is highly unlikely. On error, save, reboot
the game and enter the command in the game console.

Now enter the following commands:

"VampireTweaker-ThirstEffect_Uninstall"
"VampireTweaker-BiteMarkEffect_Uninstall"

And follow the same instructions as in the previous steps

And the mod will do this with every sim game that has some data stored by the mod. The uninstallation is completed as

COMPATIBILITY



This mod is not compatible with the following mods:



- Shoni's Vampire Overhaul

- Diriel Bloody Meals (Compatible is the mod, although it is not necessary to have it because Tweaker Vampire already has this feature)

- Im not Heating Up (from missyhissi)

- No Sparkles (of missyhissi)

- Autonomous Vampires (pcexpert)

- Immortal Supernatural Creatures (my mod :))



The other vampire mods work perfectly together in this. However there are more details that may interest compatibility. Read on.


Only some functions Shoni's Vampire Overhaul are not compatible. However, here specified which of these modules is compatible with Vampire

Tweaker:



- Shoni's Vampire Overhaul NO V

- Shoni's Vampire Overhaul No tattoo

- Shoni's Vampire Overhaul Minor Things




These versions work perfectly with Vampire Tweaker, but note that the operation of other different mods Tweaker is a Vampire
 
unpredictable.

However, many of the functions of these mods are already included, enhanced or modified, so I hope you do not mind
these
:) incompatibilities.

 If incompatibilities view more, please say me to update this list.
