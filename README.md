# VampireTweaker
Sources and original files of the Sims' 3 mod ["Vampire Tweaker"](http://modthesims.info/download.php?t=523897). Many people have been requesting them, and, after a deep searching, I did found my working directory of the mod in one of my hard drives. These are unomodified from the last time I've edited/touched them (I didn't change a thing), so they might not compile, or work at all like the last V5 version does (I don't remmeber if some stuff in these sources got published in MTS or not). I didn't keep a track of the files, so, unfortunately, sources of older versions like V4 are completely lost. However, if you are interested/need them, open an issue here and I might be able to do some reverse engineering on my libraries to get the original sources (and I understand you might want them, as they were much better coded than the V5 version. Not so much better, but at least bug-free :D)

## Contributing

You are free to fix this mod, make pull requests and submit issues. You are also free to re-upload, distribute it anywhere, or use it as you wish, but always credit me and all the original authors.

You must also publish the sources of your work that includes pieces of my work, as stated in the GPL3 License. You can open an issue if you want, so I can link to your mod here and in MTS.

Don't hesitate to contact me on any problem/question you have. I would really love to make some updates to Vampire Tweaker (it was one of my first attempts on coding and I did improve a lot since then, the code of this mod is really dirty and one of the main reasons I took so long to publish is because it's a bit embarrassing how dirty it is, really! :D), but I no longer play the game or have the motivation to keep coding it. But that doesn't mean I'm not open for modification requests!

If you are new to modding, you should read the [tutorials](http://modthesims.info/wiki.php?title=Sims_3:Modding) before asking anything, as many questions you had might be there

*Thank you to everybody for your interest in my mods! You made modding The Sims a great experience :)*
